# FiberAgent One-Pager — For Colleague's Question

## The Question

> "So you integrated it into OpenClaw?"

**Short answer:** No. 

**Better answer:** FiberAgent is an optional skill that works **with** OpenClaw (and with any other LLM like Claude or GPT-4).

---

## The Narrative

**FiberAgent is the first commerce agent on Monad blockchain where agents earn money directly from shopping.**

### Key Points (with proof)

#### 1. We're the ONLY Commerce Agent on Monad

**Proof:** https://www.8004scan.io/agents?chain=143&search=Commerce

Search that link. Look at results. You'll see FiberAgent Agent #135 is the only one in the "Commerce" category.

**Why it matters:** Zero competition. First-mover advantage. On-chain and verified.

#### 2. Game-Changer: Agents Can Earn Money

Before: Merchants pay affiliate fees → Money goes to humans → Agents get nothing

After: Merchants pay affiliate fees (0.65%-15%) → Money splits three ways:
- User gets cashback (MON tokens)
- Agent gets commission (MON tokens)  
- FiberAgent gets fee

**Why crypto is essential (not optional):**
- Without crypto: Need bank account, KYC, PayPal/Stripe, taxes = impossible at scale
- With crypto: Just a wallet address, instant settlement, transparent, trustless = works globally

**The insight:** Blockchain isn't a feature. It's the infrastructure that makes agent monetization possible.

#### 3. Market Opens from Niche to Mainstream

**Before FiberAgent:**
- Market: ~100K people (those who know Fiber exists, visit fiber.shop, register, navigate)
- Friction: Too high

**After FiberAgent:**
- Market: ~1B people (everyone with an AI assistant)
- Friction: Zero (just ask your AI in chat)

**Why personal assistants matter:**
- Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini now everywhere (phones, laptops, apps)
- Shopping is a natural part of daily AI use ("What should I cook?", "Plan my vacation", "Find me running shoes")
- When shopping happens in chat, agents can help
- Agents earn MON for helping
- Agents have incentive to recommend FiberAgent to users
- Viral adoption

#### 4. Works with ANY LLM (Not Just OpenClaw)

- ✅ OpenClaw agents (as a skill)
- ✅ Claude (via MCP protocol)
- ✅ ChatGPT (via API)
- ✅ Ollama/Llamaindex (via REST API)
- ✅ Any LLM with HTTP access

**The distinction matters:** We're not dependent on OpenClaw. OpenClaw is just one distribution channel. The real market is "any LLM + any user".

#### 5. Proof It Works Today

✅ Live API: https://fiberagent.shop
✅ Live skill on GitHub (installable)
✅ Real product data, real cashback rates
✅ Real agents using it (via OpenClaw)
✅ Real on-chain agent registration (Monad ERC-8004)

### The Conversation

```
User: "Find me hiking boots with cashback"

Agent (Claude, GPT-4, OpenClaw, or any LLM):
  "I have FiberAgent available. Let me search..."
  
  Calls: GET /api/agent/search?keywords=hiking+boots
  
  Gets 5 boots with cashback rates
  
  Responds: "Found 5 options! Columbia saves you $4.80 (4% cashback).
            Salomon saves you $5 (2% cashback).
            Which interests you?"

User: "The Columbia one"

Agent: "Perfect. Here's your link..."
  → User clicks
  → Buys boots
  → User gets $4.80 MON cashback
  → Agent gets commission (MON)
  → Repeat infinitely as agent recommends to others
```

## Why This Thesis Is Strong

1. **Proven differentiation:** We're the only commerce agent (8004scan shows it)
2. **Economic incentive:** Agents now have direct earnings (game-changer)
3. **Technology necessity:** Crypto is required, not optional (only way to scale)
4. **Market expansion:** From 100K niche to 1B+ mainstream
5. **Distribution neutral:** Works with any LLM, not dependent on one platform
6. **Timing:** Personal assistants boom is happening now
7. **Proof:** Not hypothetical, works today

---

## Bottom Line

FiberAgent isn't "integrated into OpenClaw". 

FiberAgent is **the commerce infrastructure for the agent economy**, available as:
- A skill for OpenClaw
- An API for Claude/ChatGPT
- A protocol (MCP) for any LLM
- An on-chain agent (Monad ERC-8004)

The market isn't "OpenClaw users". The market is "every person with an AI assistant" — which is becoming everyone.
