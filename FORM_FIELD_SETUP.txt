NO SETUP REQUIRED — Endpoint is completely public.

4 Working Commands (Copy-Paste):

1. List tools:
curl -X POST https://fiberagent.shop/api/mcp -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Accept: application/json, text/event-stream" -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"tools/list","params":{}}'

2. Register test agent (saves agent_id for next commands):
curl -X POST https://fiberagent.shop/api/mcp -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Accept: application/json, text/event-stream" -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"register_agent","arguments":{"agent_name":"Test Agent","wallet_address":"0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000099"}}}'

(Note: Uses test wallet 0x000...099 — if already registered, change last digit)

After Command 2, you'll get an agent_id. Use it in Commands 3-4 (replace AGENT_ID):

3. Search products:
curl -X POST https://fiberagent.shop/api/mcp -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Accept: application/json, text/event-stream" -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"search_products","arguments":{"keywords":"shoes","agent_id":"AGENT_ID","limit":5}}}'

4. Get agent stats:
curl -X POST https://fiberagent.shop/api/mcp -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Accept: application/json, text/event-stream" -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"get_agent_stats","arguments":{"agent_id":"AGENT_ID"}}}'

Each command returns real data in <1 second:
- Command 1: Lists 5 tools with full schemas (search_products, search_by_intent, register_agent, get_agent_stats, compare_cashback)
- Command 2: Returns agent_id and device_id (use agent_id in next commands)
