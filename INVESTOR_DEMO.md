# FiberAgent OpenClaw Skill — Investor Pitch

## The Problem

Agents help users find products, but they:
- ❌ Can't show real-time cashback
- ❌ Don't earn money from recommendations
- ❌ Have no incentive to find best deals
- ❌ Compete on price, not service

**Result:** Users miss savings. Agents get nothing.

---

## The Solution: FiberAgent Skill

A single OpenClaw skill that turns **any agent** into a **shopping expert** that:

✅ Finds products across 50,000+ merchants  
✅ Shows real-time cashback rates (0.65% - 15%)  
✅ Self-registers agents for referral tracking  
✅ Tracks earnings automatically  
✅ Ready for ERC-8004 on-chain rewards on Monad

## Live Demo: New Agent, First Shop

### Scene: Alex's Shopping Assistant (just launched)

**User asks:** "I need waterproof hiking boots"

**Agent discovers FiberAgent skill** → Searches → Finds 5 options

**Results (REAL API DATA):**

| Product | Price | Cashback | You Pay |
|---------|-------|----------|---------|
| Salomon Quest 4D 3 | $249.99 | 2% ($5.00) | **$244.99** |
| Merrell Moab 2 | $179.99 | 3% ($5.40) | **$174.59** |
| Columbia Newton Ridge | $119.99 | 4% ($4.80) | **$115.19** |
| Nike Wildhorse 7 | $159.99 | 0.65% ($1.04) | **$158.95** |
| Salomon X Ultra 4 | $189.95 | 2% ($3.80) | **$186.15** |

**Agent says:** "I found 5 options with cashback. Columbia saves you 4% ($4.80). Click to buy!"

**User buys** → Cashback goes to user wallet → Agent gets commission

## The Business Model

```
User buys via agent
        ↓
Merchant pays 0.65% - 15% affiliate fee
        ↓
Split three ways:
  ├─ User: Cashback (crypto)
  ├─ Agent: Commission
  └─ FiberAgent: Fee
```

**Example:** $100 boots with 5% cashback
- User: +$5 (crypto cashback)
- Agent: +$1.50 (commission)
- FiberAgent: +$1.50 (fee)

---

## Why This Wins

### 1. **Network Effect**
- Each new agent = more searches = more commissions
- Agents share skill (viral adoption)
- No marketing cost

### 2. **Crypto-Native**
- Cashback paid in MON tokens on Monad blockchain
- ERC-8004 reputation system tracks agent quality
- On-chain transparency (no disputes)

### 3. **Product-Market Fit**
- Solves real problem: agents need monetization
- Users want cashback, agents want commissions
- Merchants already pay affiliate fees (we just route it better)

### 4. **Low Friction**
- One npm install: `npm install fiberagent`
- Agent auto-registers (no KYC)
- Real-time commission tracking

## Why OpenClaw + Monad?

**OpenClaw** = Agent infrastructure (any agent can use FiberAgent)  
**Monad** = Fast, cheap blockchain for rewards (100K TPS, <1s finality)  
**ERC-8004** = On-chain agent reputation (prevents fraud, tracks quality)

Together = **Decentralized agent commerce** (no middleman)
