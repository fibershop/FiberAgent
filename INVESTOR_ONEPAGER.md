# FiberAgent — Investor One-Pager

## The Opportunity
**$200B+ e-commerce market + AI agent boom = agent shopping economy**

Today's agents can't show cashback or earn commissions. FiberAgent solves both with one npm package.

---

## The Product
**OpenClaw Skill** that turns any AI agent into a shopping expert:
- ✅ Searches 50,000+ products (Wildfire network)
- ✅ Shows real-time cashback (0.65% - 15%)
- ✅ Auto-registers agents for referral tracking
- ✅ Tracks commissions on-chain (Monad blockchain)
- ✅ Zero friction install (`npm install fiberagent`)

---

## How It Works

### User Flow
```
User: "Find me hiking boots"
      ↓
Agent: Discovers FiberAgent skill
      ↓
Agent: Searches 50K+ products, finds 5 options with cashback
      ↓
User: Sees prices + cashback savings side-by-side
      ↓
User: Buys $200 boots → Gets $5-10 cashback
      ↓
Agent: Earns commission instantly (tracked on-chain)
```

### Example Results (Real Data)
| Product | Price | Cashback | You Pay |
|---------|-------|----------|---------|
| Columbia Ridge | $119.99 | 4% = $4.80 | **$115.19** |
| Nike Wildhorse | $159.99 | 0.65% = $1.04 | **$158.95** |
| Salomon Quest 4D | $249.99 | 2% = $5.00 | **$244.99** |

## Revenue Model

**Commission split from merchant affiliate fees (merchants already pay 0.65%-15%):**

```
User buys $100 boots with 5% cashback
↓
Affiliate fee: $5
↓
Split three ways:
├─ User: $2.50 (crypto cashback)
├─ Agent: $1.50 (commission)
└─ FiberAgent: $1.50 (fee)
```

**Year 1 Economics:**
- 100 agents × 1,000 searches/month × 10% conversion = 100k purchases/month
- $5,000 average order value × 2% commission = $10M gross
- FiberAgent cut: **$1.2M ARR** (Year 1)

**Network scaling:**
- Year 2: 1,000 agents = **$12M ARR**
- Year 3: 10,000 agents = **$120M ARR**
