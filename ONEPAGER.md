# FiberAgent — One-Pager

## The Idea

**FiberAgent is the first commerce agent where users don't need to go anywhere. They just chat with their AI and get products with cashback.**

---

## Why This Matters

### 1. We're The ONLY Commerce Agent (Proven)

Check 8004scan: https://www.8004scan.io/agents?chain=143&search=Commerce

**Result:** FiberAgent is the only agent registered in the "Commerce" category on Monad.

- Zero competitors
- First-mover advantage
- On-chain verified (irreversible)

---

### 2. Zero Friction (The Game-Changer)

**Old Way:**
```
User wants shoes
  ↓
User goes to Fiber website
  ↓
User registers account
  ↓
User navigates search
  ↓
User finds shoes
  ↓
User buys
```
Market: ~100K people (who know Fiber exists)

**New Way:**
```
User: "Find me hiking boots with cashback"
  ↓
User's AI: "Found 5 options. Columbia saves you $4.80..."
  ↓
User buys
```
Market: 1B+ people (everyone with an AI)

**No friction. Users stay in chat.**

---

### 3. Crypto Is Required (Not Optional)

**Why blockchain is essential:**

Without crypto:
- Need bank account (regulatory nightmare)
- Need KYC (friction)
- Need PayPal/Stripe (fees, chargebacks)
- Agents can't earn globally

Result: **Impossible at scale**

With crypto (MON):
- Just a wallet address
- Instant settlement
- No middleman
- Agents earn instantly, globally

Result: **Works worldwide, trustlessly**

**Key insight:** This only works because agents earn cryptocurrency.

---

### 4. Market Explodes (100K → 1B+)

**Before FiberAgent:**
- Only people at fiber.shop
- Friction-heavy
- Niche market: ~100K

**After FiberAgent:**
- Works in any AI chat (Claude, ChatGPT, local models, OpenClaw, etc.)
- Zero friction (just ask)
- Mainstream market: 1B+ people with personal AI

**Driver:** Personal assistants are becoming standard
- Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini now everywhere
- Shopping is a natural daily use case
- When shopping happens in chat, we own it

---

### 5. Agents Become Profitable

**The game-changer:** Agents now have direct economic incentive.

```
Before:
  User buys shoes
  ↓
  Merchant pays affiliate fee
  ↓
  Money goes to humans
  ↓
  Agent earns: $0

After:
  User buys shoes ($100)
  ↓
  Merchant pays 5% affiliate fee ($5)
  ↓
  Split three ways:
    ├─ User: $2.50 cashback (MON)
    ├─ Agent: $1.50 commission (MON)
    └─ FiberAgent: $1.00 fee
  ↓
  Agent earns: MON tokens (recurring)
```

**Result:** Agents have incentive to recommend FiberAgent to users. Viral adoption.

---

### 6. Personal AI Is Exploding (Timing)

Shopping is about to become a core AI use case:

```
Today: "Hey Claude, what should I cook?"
       "Plan my vacation"
       "Write an email"
       
Tomorrow: "Find me running shoes with cashback"
         ↑ This is where FiberAgent wins
```

Personal assistants are coming fast. Shopping is a big part. We're ready.
