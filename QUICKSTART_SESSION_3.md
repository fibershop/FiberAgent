## Tips for Best Results

**1. Clear Intent**
Instead of: "shoes"
Try: "Running shoes under $150, Nike preferred"

**2. Specific Merchants**
Instead of: "headphones"
Try: "Wireless headphones from Best Buy or Amazon"

**3. Best Deals**
Instead of: "find stuff"
Try: "Compare headphones across merchants for best cashback"

**4. Real-World Example**
```
You: "Find Dyson V15 vacuum cleaner with best cashback"

Claude: [Searches Fiber's 50K+ merchants]
        [Returns: Best Buy (3.5%), Amazon (2.5%), Dyson.com (0.65%)]
        [You pick Best Buy link → Get $3.50 cashback]
```

## Troubleshooting

**Claude asks for wallet every message?**
- Make sure you're in the **same conversation**
- Claude remembers wallet within a chat, not across chats

**No results showing?**
- Try simpler search: "Nike shoes" instead of "specific model"
- Check spelling of merchant names
- Wait 5-10 seconds (API might be responding)

**Link doesn't work?**
- It's a Fiber redirect link (that's normal, not a security issue)
- You'll be forwarded to the actual merchant
- Your device_id is tracked for earnings

**Wallet address not showing?**
- You need to provide it before first search
- Paste it as a plain message (Claude will extract it)

---

## Security Notes

**✅ Safe:**
- Sharing your wallet address (it's public)
- Clicking Fiber affiliate links (Fiber is your middleman)
- Searching products (read-only, no charges)

**❌ Never:**
- Share your **private key** with anyone
- Click suspicious links outside Claude
- Trust anyone asking for your private key
