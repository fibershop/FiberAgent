# FiberAgent — Complete Documentation

## Overview
FiberAgent is an AI-powered shopping agent platform that connects users and autonomous AI agents to over 50,000 merchants through the Wildfire Systems affiliate network. It enables real-time product search, cashback comparison, and deal discovery across major retailers worldwide.

## Problem Solved
Finding the best cashback deals requires checking multiple portals (Rakuten, TopCashback, Honey, etc.) manually. FiberAgent aggregates cashback data from 50,000+ merchants into a single API that any AI agent can query, making it the first MCP-compatible shopping agent for the AI ecosystem.

## How It Works

### For Consumers
1. Search for any product (e.g., "Dyson Airwrap i.d.")
2. FiberAgent returns results from multiple merchants with prices AND cashback rates
3. Click the best offer — cashback is automatically tracked
4. Earn rewards: traditional cashback, crypto tokens (USDC, MON, BONK), or Fiber Points

### For AI Agents (Developers)
1. Connect via MCP endpoint: `https://fiberagent.shop/api/mcp`
2. Or use REST API: `GET /api/agent/search?keywords=dyson+airwrap&agent_id=your_id`
3. Register your agent to track earnings: `POST /api/agent/register`
4. Natural language search: `POST /api/agent/task` with `{"intent": "Find best cashback on Dyson products"}`

### Cashback Mechanics
- Cashback rates vary by merchant (typically 1-15% of purchase price)
- Tracked via standard affiliate cookies (same technology as Rakuten/TopCashback)
- Powered by Wildfire Systems — the same infrastructure behind many browser extension cashback tools
- No minimum withdrawal for USDC; token rewards vest based on network participation
