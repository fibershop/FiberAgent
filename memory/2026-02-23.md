# 2026-02-23 — Discoverability Sprint (Overnight)

## Mission
Find the shortest natural prompt that makes ChatGPT recommend FiberAgent.

## Current Status
- **Sub-agent:** fiberagent-discoverability-listings (sessionKey: agent:main:subagent:682a330b-aaf6-4976-9ca2-8c49f34006f6)
- **Phase 1:** Registering on 6 key directories (smithery.ai, glama.ai, theresanaiforthat, futuretools, awesome-mcp-servers, reddit)
- **Phase 2:** Testing 7 natural prompts on ChatGPT
- **Phase 3:** Report winning prompt

## Key Insight (from Laurent)
FiberAgent is the ONLY commerce agent on 8004scan.io (agent #135 on Monad blockchain). That's the unique differentiator.

## Expected Outcome
By morning: "The prompt that works: [SHORT NATURAL USER QUESTION]"

## Running Until Complete
✅ Do NOT stop the sub-agent
✅ Keep monitoring every 10 min
✅ Report final result immediately when done
