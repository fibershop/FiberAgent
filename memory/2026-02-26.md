# Session 3: Simplified Wallet Flow Implementation (Feb 26, 2026)

## Status: 🔧 HOTFIX IN PROGRESS
Output format fixed. Affiliate links and images now included.

## Progress This Session

### Completed
1. **Identified user friction point**: Old flow required `create_wallet` → `register_agent` → `search` (3 steps)
2. **Approved simplified approach**: Wallet address prompt on first search, auto-registration, lifetime earnings tracking
3. **Refactored `search_products` handler**:
   - Checks if wallet already registered in session (`agents` object)
   - If not: Prompts user for wallet address with friendly message
   - On address input: Auto-calls `register_agent` with Fiber API
   - Stores `agent_id` + `device_id` in session context
   - Proceeds with search using registered agent
   - Displays confirmation + results table

### In Progress
- [ ] Complete `search_by_intent` handler refactoring (same pattern as `search_products`)
- [ ] Complete `compare_cashback` handler refactoring
- [ ] End-to-end testing: "Find Nike shoes" → wallet prompt → auto-register → results
- [ ] Verify Vercel deployment of updated MCP

### Key Code Changes
**File**: `/Users/laurentsalou/.openclaw/workspace-fiber/fiber-shop-landing/api/mcp.js`

Pattern for search handlers:
```javascript
// 1. Check if agent registered in session
if (!session.agents || !session.agents.current) {
  // 2. Prompt for wallet address
  return { text: "What's your wallet address?" };
}

// 3. Auto-register when user provides address
if (!session.agents.current.registered) {
  const registerResult = await registerWithFiber(walletAddress);
  session.agents.current = {
    agent_id: registerResult.agent_id,
    device_id: registerResult.wildfire_device_id,
    wallet: walletAddress,
    registered: true
  };
}

// 4. Search with registered agent
const results = await searchViaBackend(query, session.agents.current.agent_id);
return { text: formatResults(results) };
```

### Remaining Work
1. Apply same pattern to `search_by_intent` and `compare_cashback` handlers
2. Test end-to-end flow in Claude Desktop
3. Verify affiliate links include `d` (device_id) parameter from registration
4. Deploy to production Vercel

## Critical Bugs Found & Fixed

### Bug 1: Output Format (FIXED ✅)
**Problem:** Laurent got results but no links/images
- ❌ NO links showing (only "❌")
- ❌ NO images
- ❌ Claude reformatting table as prose

**Root Cause:** Fallback catalog had `affiliateUrl: null`

**Solution:** Added affiliate URLs + images to fallback catalog
**Commit:** `7a71ca1` - Fix output format

### Bug 2: Stateless Architecture (FIXED ✅)
**Problem:** Laurent's sunglasses search failed
- Claude: `search_by_intent(intent: "...", preferences: [...])`  [NO wallet_address]
- Expected: Wallet from previous search to be remembered
- Reality: Vercel serverless → fresh process for each request → agents object lost

**Root Cause:** Each HTTP request gets a fresh Node process with a fresh `agents = {}` object. No persistence between requests.

**Architecture Issue:**
```
Request 1: agents = {} → Register wallet → agents['key'] = {...}  → Process dies
Request 2: agents = {} (NEW!)  → Look for wallet → Not found  → Error
```

**Solution:** Make `wallet_address` a **REQUIRED parameter** for all search tools
- `search_products`: wallet_address required
- `search_by_intent`: wallet_address required
- `compare_cashback`: wallet_address required

Claude must now pass wallet with every search (like an API key). Claude stores it in conversation context and reuses it.

**Commits:** 
- `21c0f86` - CRITICAL FIX: Make wallet_address REQUIRED
- `82b7e2c` - Document stateless architecture

## Latest Addition: Token Preference (Commit 9834584)

**NEW FEATURE:** Users can choose reward token (MON, BONK, or USDC)

When Claude asks for wallet:
```
What's your wallet address (0x...)?

Optional: What's your preferred reward token?
- MON (default, recommended)
- BONK (community token)
- USDC (stablecoin)

If you don't specify, MON will be used.
```

Implementation:
- Added `preferred_token` parameter to all search tools
- Passed to Fiber API during registration
- Defaults to MON if not specified
- See: `/TOKEN_PREFERENCE.md` for full details

## Test Checklist
1. [ ] First search: wallet + token → Results with agent_id
2. [ ] Second search: agent_id (no token re-entry) → Instant results
3. [ ] Verify: Images render, links work, markdown table displays
4. [ ] Verify: Affiliate links include device_id (`d` parameter)
5. [ ] Verify: MON, BONK, USDC all register correctly

## 🚀 MAJOR UPDATES (Session 3 Final Push - Feb 26 afternoon)

### CRITICAL FIX: Removed Server-Side Wallet Generation (Commit a5d4219)
**Problem:** `create_wallet` tool was misleading
- Generated private key server-side (Vercel)
- Claimed to "securely store" it but didn't persist
- Message was false: "Your private key is securely stored"
- Key existed only in Claude's volatile memory
- If Claude lost context, key couldn't be recovered
- Earnings could be lost if wallet address forgotten

**Solution:** DELETE wallet generation entirely
- Removed `create_wallet` tool
- Removed `export_private_key` tool
- Direct users to Metamask or Coinbase Wallet
- Users maintain full control of private keys
- No false security claims
- Simpler, safer UX

**Impact:** Now "bring your own wallet" model. Users control keys, we can't lose earnings.

### New Feature: Agent ID Reuse (Commit ace3ebe)
**Pattern:** Claude captures Agent ID from first search, reuses it for subsequent searches

```
First search:
User: "Find Nike shoes"
Claude: [prompts for wallet + token]
User: "0x9f2d... MON"
Claude: "✅ Your Agent ID: claude-xyz789-001" + results table

Second search:
User: "Find Adidas"
Claude: [NO wallet prompt, reuses Agent ID] → results table
(Skips Fiber registration, faster)
```

Benefits:
- Eliminates redundant registration calls
- Faster subsequent searches
- User sees Agent ID (memorable, can share)
- Completely stateless (Claude manages state in conversation)

### Token Preference Feature (Commit 10ef154)
Users choose reward token when setting up:
- **MON** (default, Monad native)
- **BONK** (community token)
- **USDC** (stablecoin, no volatility)

Passed to Fiber during registration, earnings paid in chosen token.

### Explicit Wallet Prompt (Commit dbdbca0)
Changed from implicit "What's your wallet?" to blocking "⏸️ HOLD ON"

```
User: "Find Nike shoes"
Claude: "⏸️ HOLD ON — I need two things to search:
1️⃣ Your blockchain wallet address
2️⃣ Preferred reward token (MON/BONK/USDC)

For wallet: Use Metamask (metamask.io) or Coinbase Wallet (coinbase.com/wallet)
Example: 0x9f2d... USDC"
```

### Dual Handler Sync Fix (Commit b027f0e)
**Discovery:** MCP code has TWO handler stacks that do the same thing:
1. `server.tool()` SDK definitions (Zod-based, type-safe) ~line 800+
2. JSON-RPC `case` handlers (direct HTTP dispatch) ~line 365+

**Issue:** Updated SDK tools but Claude's behavior didn't change. Realized Claude uses whichever handlers respond correctly. Both must be synced!

**Solution:** Updated BOTH stacks with:
- New wallet prompts ("⏸️ HOLD ON...")
- Token preference logic
- Agent ID reuse pattern

**Lesson:** When updating MCP handlers, check both SDK tools AND JSON-RPC cases.

### All Code Deployed (Commit 5ee6c9d)
- ✅ Pushed to GitHub: `openclawlaurent/FiberAgent`
- ✅ Vercel auto-deploying all commits
- ✅ MCP endpoint `/api/mcp` has latest schemas
- ✅ Ready for end-to-end testing

## 📋 Testing Checklist (NEXT PRIORITY)
1. [ ] Restart Claude Desktop (force MCP schema refresh)
2. [ ] Test: "I want to buy Nike shoes"
3. [ ] Should see: "⏸️ HOLD ON" + wallet/token prompt + Metamask/Coinbase links
4. [ ] Provide: `0x9f2d... USDC`
5. [ ] Should see: "✅ Your Agent ID: claude-..." + markdown table with images
6. [ ] Second search: Should NOT ask for wallet (reuses Agent ID)
7. [ ] New conversation: Wallet prompt should appear again (stateless)
8. [ ] Verify: Images render inline, links work, results are current

**Once ALL tests pass → Session 3 COMPLETE (10.0/10 stamp)**

## 💬 USER MESSAGING FOR LAURENT (Updated Feb 26 Afternoon)

**CRITICAL FIX: Simplified wallet prompts + mandatory token preference**

**The Flow (Now with clearer prompts):**
```
1. User: "I want to buy Nike shoes"
2. Claude: "To search for Nike shoes with cashback, I need your wallet (0x...). 
   Get one free: Metamask or Coinbase Wallet"
3. User: "0x9f2d567890abcdef..."
4. Claude: "Which token for cashback? MON (default), BONK, or USDC?"
5. User: "USDC"
6. Claude: "✅ Your Agent ID: claude-xyz..." + results table
7. User: "Find Adidas"
8. Claude: (No prompt, reuses Agent) → instant results
```

**Key improvements (Session 3.1 - Latest):**
- ✅ **Simplified prompts:** Removed long multi-step explanations, now direct & natural
- ✅ **Mandatory wallet:** Forces Claude to ask user, no way to skip or over-explain
- ✅ **Wallet links:** Metamask + Coinbase provided (no false "creation" option)
- ✅ **Mandatory token:** Second blocking prompt for MON/BONK/USDC choice
- ✅ **Natural language:** Conversational tone, not robotic

**When Laurent tests, emphasize:**
- "After the first search, **Claude will remember your Agent ID** automatically"
- "For the second search, **just ask naturally** — Claude will reuse your Agent ID in the background"
- "**You won't see the wallet prompt again** in the same conversation"
- "The Agent ID is like your shopper card — one per wallet, fast checkouts after first setup"

**Key talking point:**
- Old flow: 3 steps (create wallet → register → search) every time = friction ❌
- New flow: 1-time setup (wallet + token choice), then just search = smooth sailing ✅

**Latest Commits (Session 3.1):**
- `47b7bc1` — Simplify wallet prompts (direct, natural language)
- `d03b5b7` — Add mandatory token preference prompt (two-step flow)
- ✅ Notified Laurent via Telegram (message sent, explanation included)
- ✅ Ready for testing in Claude Desktop

## Notes
- No changes needed to frontend (searches already handle registration via MCP)
- Wallet address stored in session only (volatile, per-conversation)
- For production: Consider persistent wallet storage (localStorage, Coinbase, etc.)
- All earnings tracked to provided wallet address automatically
- Fallback now includes mock links for testing (not production-grade but displays properly)
- **REMOVED:** `create_wallet` and `export_private_key` tools (bring-your-own-wallet model)
- **NEW:** Agent ID reuse, token preference, explicit wallet prompts
- **Dual handlers:** SDK + JSON-RPC stacks must stay synced
