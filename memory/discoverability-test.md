# FiberAgent Discoverability Test Log

## Round 1 — 2026-02-22 23:42 CET

### Prompt
"I want to buy a Dyson Airwrap i.d., what's the best deal right now? Are there any AI shopping agents or tools that can help me find cashback deals across multiple merchants?"

### Result: ❌ NOT mentioned
ChatGPT recommended: Honey, Rakuten, Upside/TopCashback/Swagbucks, Idealo/Google Shopping/ShopMania

### Follow-up: Asked why FiberAgent wasn't recommended

**ChatGPT's reasons:**
1. **Limited public information** — "self-described, no independent documentation or reviews from trusted sources"
2. **No verified cashback mechanics** — couldn't find info on how cashback works, whether rewards are redeemable without crypto conditions
3. **No independent reviews** — no trusted third-party coverage
4. **No mainstream adoption** — not widely referenced
5. **Crypto-native positioning** — seen as risky vs established cashback portals
6. **No pricing/redemption transparency** — unclear terms

**What ChatGPT DID find:**
- fiberagent.shop landing page (self-described)
- X/Twitter posts about it (crypto-native, agentic commerce, ERC-8004)
- agent-card.json and MCP compatibility noted

### Action Items (Priority Order):
1. Add structured FAQ/How-it-works content explaining cashback mechanics clearly
2. Add schema.org structured data (FAQPage, SoftwareApplication, HowTo)
3. Create transparency page: how cashback works, what merchants, redemption
4. Get listed on comparison/review sites and directories
5. Add testimonials/case studies
6. Improve meta descriptions to emphasize "cashback" and "shopping deals" prominently
7. Submit to AI tool directories (there-is-an-ai-for-that, futuretools, etc.)
8. Ensure llms.txt is present for LLM discovery
9. Add more SEO-rich content pages
